# TIL (Today I Learned)
### git is fun



## Nov 14 2017
Realized git and github were two entirely different entities. Learned basic commands of git commandline and soon realized it was better to use commandline than git gui. Performed 'push' and 'pull' to and from my repo in the newly created github account. Staging, merging, branching are few other things i learned today.

Additionally, I added ssh pubpublic keys to my git account so that i did not have to write my uname and password each time I communicate to github server.

##### Summary of command used:

```bash

$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git remote set-url origin <url- name>
$ git push origin master

```
